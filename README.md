# uw-01-accessibility
This is a homework assignment for the UW Bootcamp to teach web accessibility. The site is for a fictional marketing agency named Horiseon.

## Purpose

The purpose of the assignment was to refactor a website to make it more accessible for screen readers (adding img alt attributes and semantic HTML). There were also opportunities to clean up the code to remove redundant selectors, improve structure, and add comments for developer clarity.

As extra credit, I also made the styling more responsive for narrower screens using media queries and flexbox.
